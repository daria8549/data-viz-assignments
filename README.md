# Data Visualization Assignments

This repository contains my submissions for a university course on data visualization using Python. The projects use real-world datasets and generate static and interactive visualizations to support exploratory data analysis.

## Assignments

### Assignment 2 – Titanic Dataset
- Visualizes survival by class, age, and gender
- Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Dataset: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`

### Assignment 3 – Power Plant Visualization
- Geo-based analysis of energy production
- Tools: Folium, Plotly
- Dataset: `global_power_plant_database.csv`
- Output: `map_output.html` (interactive)

### Assignment 4 – Netflix & Treatment Mapping
- Visual analysis of Netflix title attributes
- Participant data mapped by treatment group
- Datasets: `netflix_titles.csv` + treatment data
- Output: `scatterplot_by_treatment.png`, `map_treatment1.html`–`map_treatment4.html`

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- HTML/CSS for exported maps

> All projects reflect personal work for academic credit and demonstration of data storytelling techniques.
